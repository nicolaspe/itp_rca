# Take your time: a conversation - Olafur Eliasson and Robert Irwin

> "Artworks are not closed or static, and they do not embody some kind of truth that may be revealed to the spectator. Rather, artworks have an affinity with time—they are embedded in time, they are of time" - Olafur

> "The museum is an old, old model that was set up essentially to deal with objects. You and I are not object makers; we’re dealing with experiential processes." - Robert Irwin

Exhibitions and experiences vs creations as objects (i.e: paintings, sculpture). You need a time to experience these works, they are not instantaneous.

===

> "What is special in the case of conditional experience is, I think, what I sometimes call the introspective quality of seeing: you see whatever you’re looking at, but you also see the way you’re seeing." - OE

I find this extremely interesting, because I have always said that art is a reflection of the artist's perception. You paint what and -more importantly- how you see, you write what you experience and from your -own or fictional self- point of view. It has that personal quality that's embedded on the work itself. Making a piece for the audience to reflect on how they're seeing and perceiving it, is something I had not thought about.

> OE: "we can consider the surroundings as constructions, not truths.

> RI: They’re just conditions."

> [...]

> "But, actually, there are no frames in our perception. It’s a continuous envelope in which we move. You realize that framing is a device. [...] Initially when you break the frame you only have the crude question of in/out, since this in/out is a clear issue raised by the radical history of modern thought. The question for the modern artist is not just what would be the extended “frame of reference,” but also how would it work." - RI

===

> "The big move is when we eliminate abstract references to art history, and the person walking through the work doesn’t have to know anything about you or art. That puts it on the most immediate social level, because the observer’s referencing the same cues you are. It’s no longer an abstract referencing, it’s an experiential one. Which is what I mean by phenomenological: it’s made in real time" - RI

> [...]

> "This implies that the museum has to make its ideology accessible to visitors, but many museums lack the self-criticality to make this happen" - OE

This has a lot to do with how we give value to art. As we move away from technical "prodigies" and enter more conceptual lands, explanations are needed to grasp and appreciate a piece.

===

> "... feeling is not just a response, it’s an action" - RI

> "I see something, and by seeing it—attending to it, spending time with it, acting on it—I give it value. And so value is not neutral; once negotiated, it ultimately becomes a piece of you." - RI

===

> "When I cut the window in the angle of the corners, that really resolved it. Then some interesting things happened that I had not anticipated. One is that the glass being tinted makes the cutout appear to be more in focus . . . add all the sounds and the air and so forth and it becomes, on a visceral level, more real. Suddenly all these issues about reality and meaning as “real” are all jumbled up. Because the minute you introduce the frame, you’ve introduced the old context of representation. To have the real thing instead of the representation within the frame, you suddenly have to wrestle with the idea of why this is not art." - RI

> "I would like to suggest that the experience of something representational is not, qualitatively speaking, a less important kind of experience. To me there is nothing nonrepresentational." - OE

> "I’m of the opinion that most discussions about reality are not about reality at all—they’re about meaning. [...] When you have a frame and a representation, that assumes a whole structure of meaning. And when you flatten that out, you’re really having an argument about which of these meaning structures is most significant" - RI

> [...]

> RI: I finally realized I had something that was a pretty good example of a nonhierarchical structure. I hadn’t set out to do that, even though I’d been talking about it for a long time. You could enter the piece from any point; there was no beginning, middle, or end. At every point you had a minimum of eight choices to make, but there was no hierarchy in those choices. And when you left, you found the necessity to go back to it again, because it didn’t have handles on it

> OE: It was also nonhierarchical in terms of time. One of the reasons I went back was that not one moment seemed more important than another, which for an artistically organized experience is very unusual.

> RI: I very much like the idea that you aren’t led through something or told where to go, but instead are given a continuous set of qualitative choices. The choices are not dictatorial in any way. You’re the one who has to make them. You’re put in this position of actually constructing the aesthetics of the experience as you go, because each time you make a choice you change the nature of the experience.



# How the Art of Social Practice Is Changing the World, One Row House at a Time

[Link](http://www.artnews.com/2014/04/07/art-of-social-practice-is-changing-the-world-one-row-house-at-a-time/)

> "for its ten-week duration, the monument was just that: a place for panel discussions, seminars, Latin-music performances, and art workshops"

When you build something for the community, and make the community itself participate, the impact is much larger. You make them care for it, they will form a bond and connect with the piece.

> "Certainly, the notion of participatory art is not new. The Surrealists were staging hands-on events in Paris almost a century ago"


> "Finkelpearl defines social practice as “art that’s socially engaged, where the social interaction is at some level the art.”"


> "Nato Thompson, chief curator of Creative Time, thinks that the form is a byproduct of our technology-reliant times. “I mean, doesn’t any kind of human interaction that isn’t on the Internet just feel very special?”"

Of course human interaction is special. It always has been. The problem now is that we have something to ponder it against. That is the game-changer of out times. We don't take it for granted now, because the virtual space competes with it. But it is easy to critique when you never had something to put it against. I am of the opinion that this movement follows the rise in capitalistic individualism. It fosters self preservation, putting people against each other in order to diminish the community-focused approach and rising the competitive mindset.

> "Thompson points out that these kinds of manufactured encounters aren’t unique to the art world. “The entire foundation of the Apple Store was that it would be a place of human relations”"


> "Helguera’s interest in such interactive scenarios emerges from his own artwork. Last year, he created a crowd-sourced Spanish-language bookstore called Librería Donceles at Kent Fine Art in Chelsea, which became an impromptu hangout for Spanish speakers in a city without a dedicated Spanish-language used bookstore"

The action and interaction of the public with what-was-made is what gives the work any value.

> "Despite the current enthusiasm for social practice, it is not without its tensions, especially in sectors where art and activism overlap. As agents of change, social-practice projects can seem wanting: the scale is often small, the works are temporary, and success may depend on the charisma of a single artist. On an esthetic level, they can also be befuddling, perceived as too much like community organizing to feel truly like art"

I think we don't know how to approach this human-scale projects. And I say human-scale, not because they are for humans, but because not only their success - but their soul is what transformation in the community they make.
