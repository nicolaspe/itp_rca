## Defining Attitudes Toward Science and Technology
> "This essay aims to broaden our understanding of relationships between art, science, and technology during the 1960s by juxtaposing two of the most important, and under-examined, figures of this period, the artist Gyorgy Kepes and the engineer Billy Klüver"

Technology and science always stood apart. And science was even further away, often left behind even when talking about the subject in retrospective, taking it for granted.

#### Keves
[György Keves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Kepes) > [Center for Advanced Visual Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Program_in_Art_Culture_and_Technology) (CAVS) > Visual language as a bridge between Arts & Science
> "intended, above all, to provide a model for the interaction of the arts and sciences for society as a whole"

[Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) [ideals](http://www.theartstory.org/movement-bauhaus.htm): it was founded with the idea of creating a "total" work of art (Gesamtkunstwerk) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together

Keves failed to engage and incorporate contemporary artists, even on his six-part *Vision and Value* series, which lead to the creation of the CAVS.


#### Klüver
[Billy Klüver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Kl%C3%BCver) >  [Experiments in Art and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments_in_Art_and_Technology) (E.A.T.) > He felt that science wasn't a partner for the artist (due to its rigid nature), but technology was suited for the job (engagement and exploration)

> "The machine was not a functional object and was never treated like one. The spectacle can therefore not be judged in terms of whether this or that thing did not work"

Organized the *Nine Evenings of Art and Engineering for the Armory* with avant-garde artists and engineers. He saw the new creations as a way for the present to look into the future, not a continuation of the past.

> "The possibility of a work being created that was the preconception of neither the artist nor the engineer is the raison d’être of the organization"


#### Differences
>"Just as Kepes felt that science and art could positively inform one another, so Klüver argued that art could redefine the goals of engineering, while technology could expand the possibilities of art."

Their differences was instructive, as they gave varied perspectives to artists and the development of the field. Focusing in "science" and "technology" respectively, gave emerging artists and their ideas a home where to advance their craft.
